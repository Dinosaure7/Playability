It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States.\n\nThe game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","Rating":83.1396446541,"Genres":"Music","Platforms":"PlayStation2","Companies":"HarmonixMusicSystems, RedOctane","Cover":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_cover_big\/co1wa0.jpg","Video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8JYB2uiUe0"},"538":{"Game":"Gunman Clive","Controls":0.25,"Difficulty":2.5,"Getting Started":0.0,"Reading":1.43,"Navigation":0.0,"Visual":1.5,"Audio":2.5,"Communication":0.0,"Total":0.66,"Summary":"In the year of 18XX, the west is overrun by thugs and outlaws.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill \u2013 it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You\u2019ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that\u2019s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You\u2019ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It\u2019s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you\u2019ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","Rating":81.1364399906,"Genres":"Shooter, Tactical, Adventure","Platforms":"Linux, PC(MicrosoftWindows), Mac, PlayStation4, XboxOne, GoogleStadia","Companies":"SquareEnix, \"MipumiGames\", SumoDigital, NixxesSoftware, FeralInteractive, IOInteractive","Cover":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_cover_big\/co2fgr.jpg","Video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zHRcKErn7zw"},"586":{"Game":"Hoa","Controls":0.25,"Difficulty":0.0,"Getting Started":1.11,"Reading":2.86,"Navigation":2.14,"Visual":2.5,"Audio":5.0,"Communication":0.0,"Total":1.39,"Summary":"Hoa is a platform-adventure game featuring beautiful hand-painted art and a calm, relaxing atmosphere.

The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.\n\nKingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.\n\nThe game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.","Rating":82.8745161855,"Genres":"Role-playing(RPG), Adventure","Platforms":"PlayStation2","Companies":"DisneyInteractiveStudios, SquareElectronicArts, SonyComputerEntertainment, Square, SquareEnix, SquareProductDevelopmentDivision1","Cover":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_cover_big\/co30zf.jpg","Video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c9-hdtsy0fA"},"687":{"Game":"Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory","Controls":0.25,"Difficulty":7.5,"Getting Started":1.11,"Reading":2.14,"Navigation":0.71,"Visual":2.5,"Audio":2.5,"Communication":1.25,"Total":1.39,"Summary":"Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory is a rhythm action game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land.\n\nMeanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under his control.

The game is notable for being in development hell, having been originally developed for the Nintendo DS. This early version of the game has never been publicly shown off.\n\nThis early version has the same basic premise as the final one, with Samus trapped on an alien world, trying to survive against an unstoppable foe. And as it's a sequel to Metroid Fusion, it presumably would have carried the plot point of Samus being on the run from the Galactic Federation.\n\nNo prototype builds or ROMs have ever surfaced for this DS version, and it is unlikely Nintendo will release any. It's a possibility that concept art or screenshots of this early version will be revealed in the upcoming art book, as Nintendo is open to talking about Metroid Dread's development history.\n\nLiam Robertson of Unseen64 claims that a synopsis of the game was given out to select members of the press. And in 2010, IGN's Craig Harris said in a podcast that he had seen a complete script for Metroid Dread, and that \"Nintendo could use it anytime they wanted.\" It's possible that this was the synopsis that Liam Robertson was referring to. After the 2021 announcement of the game, Harris was asked on Twitter if he remembered anything from this script.

It was developed by LucasArts using the Unreal Engine, and published for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in 2005. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In the story, set in the Star Wars Legends expanded universe, players assume the role of RC-1138 (\"Boss\"), an elite clone trooper, known as \"clone commando\", and the leader of the special ops unit Delta Squad, consisting of three fellow clone commandos with distinctive personalities and character traits: RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"), RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"), and RC-1207 (\"Sev\"). The story follows Delta Squad as they complete increasingly difficult missions throughout the Clone Wars and learn to bond as a team.\n\nRepublic Commando received generally favorable reviews at release. Many critics praised the story and combat, but criticized the short length and average multiplayer. In the years since its release, it has come to be considered one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and has gained a cult following.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game by Aspyr is set to release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 6, 2021.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.\n\nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\n\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design.

Yoku's Island Express is a unique and quirky adventure with handcrafted visuals, where you'll soar through the air, vacuum explosive snails, fight a Screetch, feed starving lemurs, discover the mystery of the Fruit Altar, wake an old god, and hopefully help tiny Yoku rebuild the island post-office.","Rating":84.4412751281,"Genres":"Platform, Puzzle, Pinball, Adventure, Indie, Arcade","Platforms":"PC(MicrosoftWindows), PlayStation4, XboxOne, NintendoSwitch","Companies":"VillaGorilla, Team17","Cover":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_cover_big\/co26hb.jpg","Video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qdjnNntADgE"},"1552":{"Game":"Yooka-Laylee","Controls":0.5,"Difficulty":0.0,"Getting Started":2.22,"Reading":2.14,"Navigation":0.0,"Visual":0.0,"Audio":2.5,"Communication":1.25,"Total":0.9,"Summary":"Explore huge, beautiful worlds, meet (and beat) an unforgettable cast of characters and horde a vault-load of shiny collectibles as buddy-duo Yooka (the green one) and Laylee (the wisecracking bat with the big nose) embark on an epic adventure to thwart corporate creep Capital B and his devious scheme to absorb all the world\u2019s books\u2026 and convert them into pure profit!","Rating":68.7922967254,"Genres":"Platform, Adventure, Indie","Platforms":"Linux, PC(MicrosoftWindows), Mac, WiiU, PlayStation4, XboxOne, NintendoSwitch","Companies":"Team17, Playtonic","Cover":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_cover_big\/co1z4v.jpg","Video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u5BqQXuzAAQ"},"1553":{"Game":"Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair","Controls":1.0,"Difficulty":0.0,"Getting Started":2.22,"Reading":4.29,"Navigation":1.43,"Visual":2.0,"Audio":7.5,"Communication":0.0,"Total":1.89,"Summary":"Yooka and Laylee are back for a brand new adventure!
