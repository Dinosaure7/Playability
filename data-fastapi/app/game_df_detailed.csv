Players can dive into a relaxing sandbox mode with no goals, where they are simply left to delight in their own creativity and create beautiful scenes, or take on a “campaign” of six chapters, where the task is to strike a balance between nature and the manufactured by covering each scene with salvaged objects and lush vegetation.

This is a chill game where the player is allowed to delight in their own creativity. The player's task is to completely cover the scene in plants. As you overgrow the objects, a meter fills to show your progress. You are given objects to expand the scene. These objects contribute energy to the growing of plants, but you will also have to cover them in foliage to complete the stage, striking a balance between nature and the manufactured.

The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.

Hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.

HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.

An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.

Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.

Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",81.13643999061965,"['Shooter', 'Tactical', 'Adventure']","['Linux', 'PC (Microsoft Windows)', 'Mac', 'PlayStation 4', 'Xbox One', 'Google Stadia']","['Square Enix', ""Mi'pu'mi Games"", 'Sumo Digital', 'Nixxes Software', 'Feral Interactive', 'IO Interactive']",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fgr.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHRcKErn7zw

Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.

The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.",82.87451618548496,"['Role-playing (RPG)', 'Adventure']",['PlayStation 2'],"['Disney Interactive Studios', 'Square Electronic Arts', 'Sony Computer Entertainment', 'Square', 'Square Enix', 'Square Product Development Division 1']",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30zf.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9-hdtsy0fA

817,Metroid Dread,0.75,0.0,0.56,4.29,2.86,2.0,2.5,0.0,1.56,"Metroid Dread is a cancelled DS game for the Metroid series that was later reworked into the Nintendo Switch game of the same name. The game is notable for being in development hell, having been originally developed for the Nintendo DS. This early version of the game has never been publicly shown off.

This early version has the same basic premise as the final one, with Samus trapped on an alien world, trying to survive against an unstoppable foe. And as it's a sequel to Metroid Fusion, it presumably would have carried the plot point of Samus being on the run from the Galactic Federation.

No prototype builds or ROMs have ever surfaced for this DS version, and it is unlikely Nintendo will release any. It's a possibility that concept art or screenshots of this early version will be revealed in the upcoming art book, as Nintendo is open to talking about Metroid Dread's development history.

Liam Robertson of Unseen64 claims that a synopsis of the game was given out to select members of the press. And in 2010, IGN's Craig Harris said in a podcast that he had seen a complete script for Metroid Dread, and that ""Nintendo could use it anytime they wanted."" It's possible that this was the synopsis that Liam Robertson was referring to. After the 2021 announcement of the game, Harris was asked on Twitter if he remembered anything from this script. He said he didn't",,['Shooter'],['Nintendo DS'],['Nintendo'],,

Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter video game, set in the Star Wars universe. It was developed by LucasArts using the Unreal Engine, and published for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in 2005. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In the story, set in the Star Wars Legends expanded universe, players assume the role of RC-1138 (""Boss""), an elite clone trooper, known as ""clone commando"", and the leader of the special ops unit Delta Squad, consisting of three fellow clone commandos with distinctive personalities and character traits: RC-1262 (""Scorch""), RC-1140 (""Fixer""), and RC-1207 (""Sev""). The story follows Delta Squad as they complete increasingly difficult missions throughout the Clone Wars and learn to bond as a team.

Republic Commando received generally favorable reviews at release. Many critics praised the story and combat, but criticized the short length and average multiplayer. In the years since its release, it has come to be considered one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and has gained a cult following.

An enhanced port of the game by Aspyr is set to release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 6, 2021. As reported by Jordan Ramée of GameSpot, ""Handled by Aspyr Media, Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered brings the original 2005 Xbox and PC game to PS4 and Switch with enhanced HD graphics and modernized controls, though the multiplayer is absent. Otherwise, it's the same game. And though the flaws in its gameplay are only more noticeable now 16 years later, this remaster manages to still deliver a compelling story of four specialized commandos engaging in a variety of combat missions across the Clone Wars."".",82.18797495204768,"['Shooter', 'Tactical', 'Adventure']","['PC (Microsoft Windows)', 'Xbox', 'PlayStation 4', 'Nintendo Switch']","['LucasArts', 'Activision', 'Electronic Arts', 'Aspyr Media']",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2au4.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHuI7S1-Xpo

1474,Until Dawn,0.25,0.0,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,"Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.

Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.

The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.

Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.",80.23011261638476,['Adventure'],['PlayStation 4'],"['Supermassive Games', 'Sony Computer Entertainment']",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2s5q.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV_Tqi3e0eI

The game mainly consists of the player shooting his way through hordes of different types of Nazis, ranging from normal soldier to ninjas. To deal with the large amount of enemies, the player has access to many typical WWII-weapons like the German MP40 or K98 rifle. In addition, during the course of the game he finds the medallion and learns four powers. While at first entering the Veil only allows him so see enemies more clearly and use strange flying creatures as bombs, he is later able to slow down time, surround himself with a protective shield or make himself stronger. However, the medallion's powers drain its energy, which needs to be refilled at power-spots that are nearly invisible in the real world.",72.34063486378359,['Shooter'],"['PC (Microsoft Windows)', 'PlayStation 3', 'Xbox 360']","['Raven Software', 'Activision']",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y02.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIao7j5e2-c
